## Introduction

These are **solo** challenges for the experienced Git / GitHub user.

If you are unfamiliar with using Git collaboratively as a team, we suggest following along with the guided hands-on workshop. You may come back to these challenges in your own free time after the workshop.

We also encourage helping other group members who are following the guided hands-on as you attempt these challenges, should they need assistance.

There are no fixed answers for the challenges; get creative and solve them in whatever way you desire!
